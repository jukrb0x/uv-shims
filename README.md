# uv-shims

The shims for [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Provide `python`, `python3`, `pip` and commands you are familiar with but running with `uv run <command>`

Also we add the support for PyLauncher on windows (`py.exe` or `py`) that are able to select the python version with
syntax like `py -3`.
